# Bandit Level 16 ‚Üí Level 17
[Here's the link üòÑ](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit17.html)

## üìù Challenge Description 
In order to move on to the next level, we must submit the password of the current level to a **port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. We have to find out which of these ports have a **SSL/TLS** server running on them. Only **1** of them will give you the credentials for the next level, the others will simply reply back to you whatever you send to it.



## üîç What I Initially Tried
Based off the level description I knew we had to utilize `nmap` in a way where I could scan specific ports on localhost. After reading through the [nmap man page](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.usage.txt) I found that we can specify the what port ranges we want to scan using the `-p` flag. Also since we need to find which specific ports have the **TLS** service running on them, the `-sV` flag allows us to determine the service/version information for each port. 

Here's the command:
```bash
nmap -sV -p 31000-32000 localhost
```
After a minute, `nmap` shows these ports that are open:
```text
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-08-05 21:04 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
31046/tcp open  echo
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
31691/tcp open  echo
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo
```

Based off the `nmap` scan, I noticed two ports were open that had **ssl** running on them, port `31518` and port `31790`. Instinctively I tried initiating a connection to the first port:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518
```
Like usual it outputted the certifcate so I tried pasting in the password for the next level, however that didn't work:
```text
read R BLOCK
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
KEYUPDATE
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
KEYUPDATE
closed
```

I kept getting a **KEYUPDATE** message and I didn't know what this really meant so I looked through the [openssl/s_client documentation](https://docs.openssl.org/3.0/man1/openssl-s_client/#options) to see why this could happen. 

Under the **CONNECTED COMMANDS** section, I was quick to find out why this message kept appearing:
```
k
Send a key update message to the server (TLSv1.3 only)
```
The reasoning behind this is that certain commands are treated differently when sending text back to the server and in this case the **letter k** sends a key update message back to the server hence why the message **KEYUPDATE** kept appearing on my end. The letters **Q, R, k, and K** all have special functions that come with them so in order to ignore them, the documentation says to use the `-quiet` flag:

```bash
openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31518
```
This was the output:
```
Can't use SSL_get_servername
depth=0 CN = SnakeOil
verify error:num=18:self-signed certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = SnakeOil
verify return:1
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
```
As you can see, the password I pasted was echoed back to the terminal meaning that port `31790` had to be the correct port. Also looking back, you can see that port `31518` had both `ssl/echo` services on running on it showing another clear indication that the other port was the correct one.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What Worked
After all of that this is what I ran:
```bash
openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
```

This gave us a **RSA Private Key** to allows us to log in to the next level:

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

From there, to get the password for the next level I needed to save this key in a file where I can use it to `ssh` into the next level however I didn't have permission to write files within the home directory so I had create a temporary one and do it from there. Here's what I did:
```bash
mktemp -d 
# Output: /tmp/tmp.l8GVcgokHN
cd /tmp/tmp.l8GVcgokHN
vi key.txt
# Pasted the key into this file
chmod 600 key.txt
# Made sure the key wasn't accessible by others
ssh -i key.txt bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
```

After everything, this was the password for **bandit17**:
```

```

## üß† Key Learnings
- Learned how to scan specific ports using `nmap` and scan for specific services.
- Learned how to effectively read through documentation to solve a specific problem for a command.
- Utilized a private RSA key to log in to another machine and making sure the permissions were set correctly on it.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used 
**Terminal:** Cygwin  
**Commands:** `nmap`, `openssl`, `s_client`, `vim`, `ssh`, `mktemp`, `cd`

## üîê Next Step
We‚Äôve successfully grabbed the password and are ready for **Level 17**.
