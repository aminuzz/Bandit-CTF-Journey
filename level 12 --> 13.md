# Bandit Level 12 ‚Üí Level 13
[Here's the link üòÑ](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html)

## üìù Challenge Description 
In this level, the password for `bandit13` is in the file `data.txt` which is a **hexdump** of a file that has been repeatedly been compressed. 







## üîç What I Initially Tried 
It says in the level description that the file is a **hexdump** of a file that **has been repeatedly compressed**. I know when you compress a file, it's to reduce the total size of the file for storage management, performance, etc. Like previous levels the first thing I did was open the file:


```
cat data.txt

Output:

After some research I found that a **hexdump** of a file is a **hexadecimal representation of binary data**. It shows the raw content of a file byte by byte, displaced as hexadecimal numbers. This is useful for inspecting non-text files or examining file corruption, as it reveals the underlying data structure. When looking through the hexdump, I found out that the bytes `1f8b` meant that this file was compressed using the **gzip algorithm**. But first we need to reverse the hexdump before we can start the decompression process.


## ‚úîÔ∏è What Worked
Before we decompress the file, I checked what permissions I had:
```bash
ls -ld
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 28 19:03 .
```
As seen here as user bandit12 I only had read and execute permissions within the home directory so I needed to make a temporary directory and work with the files in there:
```bash
mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.PgXVBPzSYN$
```

After, I copied `data.txt` to the temporary directory (`/tmp/tmp.ZDmWIhuS84`) we just created since we do not have write permissions in the home directory for this level. 
```bash
cp data.txt /tmp/tmp.ZDmWIhuS84
```

Now after some research, I found that the `xxd` command allows us to generate and reverse a hexdump file:
```bash
xxd -r data.txt > new_file.gz
```
After we move on to the next file (`new_file.gz`) and start decompression. I knew it had to be a `.gz` file because in the beginning of the hexdump the first two bytes represented that the file had been compressed with **gzip** hence the reasoning behind the file name. Now with the `gzip` command, I decompressed the file:
```bash
gzip -d new_file.gz 
```

Now since we decompressed `new_file.gz` we're now left with just `new_file` so instead of opening the file using `cat` I decided to see what type of data was in the file using the `file` command:
```bash
file new_file
new_file: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

Based off this output, we know this file has been compressed with the **bzip2 algorithm** so after reading through the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bzip2) this was the command I came up with:
```bash
bzip2 -d new_file
```

Since `new_file` didn't have the `.bz2` ending to it, the algorithm writes the output to the original file with the **.out** file extension to it. Now let's check what type of data is in `new_file.out`:
```bash
file new_file.out
new_file.out: gzip compressed data
```

Again we're back with a `.gz` file, but before we decompress we must rename the file to have the `.gz` extension:
```bash
mv new_file.out new_file.gz
gzip -d new_file.gz
```

Now I checked again what type of data the `new_file` contains:
```bash
file new_file
new_file: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

Now the file contains a `tar archive` which is a way to store multiple files into a singular file (an archive) and have the ability to manipulate the archive. This is different from compressing a file since with a **tar archive** it's just a collection of files/directories that are combined into one file. After reading the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html) and reanming the file to `new_file.tar` I ran this command:
```bash
tar -xf new_file.tar
```

Then I checked if any new files were created and I found `data5.bin` in the directory:
```bash
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.dPujjGvAN6$ ls
data5.bin  data.txt  new_file.tar
```

`data5.bin` was also a **tar archive** so I ran the same command as before on this file:
```bash
tar -xf data5.bin
```

I checked again if a new file was created and I found a file called `data6.bin`. I checked what type of data it contained and yet again it was a `bzip2` file. Knowing it was a `bzip2` file, I renamed it just for simiplicity sake and decompressed it:
```bash
file data6.bin
data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

mv data6.bin data6.bz2
bzip2 -d data6.bz2
```

Now we're left with a file called `data6` and after checking the contents of the file it was another **tar archive** so I had to extract the files:
```bash
file data6
data6: POSIX tar archive (GNU)

tar -xf data6
```

After listing out the files from the directory I found `data8.bin` so like usual I checked what type of data the file contained:
```bash
file data8.bin
data8.bin: gzip compressed data
```

Yet again we are dealing with a `gzip` file so I had to decompress it with the `gzip` command



## üß† Key Learnings
- Learning how to use the `tr` command to decipher the **ROT13** algorithm and how to use it in conjuction with other commands.
- Understood the importance of character set mapping and using pipes to feed input into commands.

## üòï Common misconceptions
While reading the `tr` command syntax, I was initially confused about which sets of letters to use and how to translate them. After some thinking, I realized that since the cipher rotates each character by 13 positions, I had to split the set of characters into two: one for the rotated characters from A-N and another for the rest. I also made sure to include both uppercase and lowercase characters in the correct order.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used 
Terminal: Cygwin

Commands: `tr`, `cat`
 

## üîê Next Step
We‚Äôve successfully grabbed the password and are ready for **Level 12**.
