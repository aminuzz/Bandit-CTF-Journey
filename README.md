# Bandit CTF Journey 🏴‍☠️

This repository documents my personal learning journey through the [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. I'm using it to deepen my understanding of Linux, file systems, basic cybersecurity concepts, and CTF methodologies.

Each level includes:
- What the challenge asks for
- My initial approach and what I tried
- Roadblocks or wrong turns I took
- The correct methodology and final solution
- Commands and tools I used
- What I learned from the process

> This repo is a living log. I'm sharing it to track my growth, help others, and hold myself accountable 💻🔥
